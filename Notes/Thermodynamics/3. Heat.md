1. Quantity of heat ( $Q, [\text{J}]$ ) - the amount of energy which is transferred during heat flow; $Q \gt 0$ means that heat flows in and $Q \lt 0$ means that heat flows out
	
	**a) calorie** - the amount of heat requird to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water from 14.5°C to 15.5°C
	
	$$1 \text{ cal} = 4.186 \text{ J}$$
	
	- a food-value calorie is actually a kilocalorie (kcal) and is 1000 times larger

2. Specific Heat / Specific Heat Capacity ( $c, \left[\frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}\cdot \text{K}}\right]$ ) - the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a certain material by 1 K. It depends slightly on the initial temperature and the temperature interval but this is usually ignored.
	
	$$Q = cm\Delta T$$
	
	- the total amount of heat required to raise the temperature of $m$ kilograms of a given material by $\Delta T$ kelvins

3. Molar Heat Capacity / Molar Specific Heat ( $C$ ) - the product of the molar mass of a substance and its specific heat capacity
	
	$$C = Mc, \left[\frac{\text{J}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{K}}\right]$$
	
	- the toal amount of heat required to raise the temperature of $n$ mols of a given substance by $\Delta T$ kelvins is then given by:
	
	$$Q = nC\Delta T$$
	
	**a) Dulong-Petit law** - the molar heat capacities for most elemental solids are the same: $\approx 25 \text{ J/mol} \cdot \text{K}$

4. Phase Transitions - for a given pressure, there is a temperature at which adding or substracting heat will not change the temperature of a system but will rather make it undergo a phase transition

	**a) heat of fusion**( $L_f, \left[\frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}\right]$) - the heat required to change one kilogram of a solid to a liquid or vice versa
	- the heat required to change $m$ kilograms of a substance from solid to liquid or vice versa is given by
	
	$$Q = \pm mL_f$$
	
	- "+" for melting, "-" for freezing
	
	**b) heat of vaporisation** ( $L_v, \left[\frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}}\right]$ ) - the heat required to boil 1 kilogram of liquid or to condense 1 kilogram of vapour
	- the heat required to boil/condense $m$ kilograms of a substance is then given by:
	
	$$Q = \pm mL_v$$
