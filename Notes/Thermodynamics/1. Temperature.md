2. Temperature scales
	
	**a) Celcius** - measured in degrees
	
	$$T_C = \frac{5}{9}(T_F - 32\degree)$$
	
	**b) Fahrenheit** - also measured in degrees but does not use the same increments and starting point as Celcius
	
	$$T_F = \frac{9}{5}(T_C + 32\degree)$$
	
	**c) Kelvin** - measured in kelvins and begins at absolute zero
	
	$$T_K = T_C + 273.15$$
