1. Conduction - occurs between objects in contact with each other
	
	**a) properties**
	- always from higher to lower temperatures
	
	**b) heat current**( $H \left[\frac{J}{s}\right]$ ), the amount of heat, $dQ$ which flows for a time $dt$ through any homogeneous object with a cross section $A$ perpendicular to the direction of heat flow and a path of heat-flow with a length $L$ 
	
	$$H = \frac{dQ}{dt} = kA \frac{T_H - T_C}{L}$$
	
	- $k, \left[\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}\cdot\text{K}}\right]$ - thermal conductivity which is specific to every material
	- $\frac{T_H - T_C}{L}$ - the temperature difference per unit length, also called the magnitude of the temperature gradient
	- proportional to the area of contact - because the heat has more area to enter into / exit from
	- inversely proportional to the length of the conductor - because the longer the conductor is, the farther heat has to travel

	**c) non-uniform temperature gradient** - when temperature doesn't change in the same way along the length of the heat flow, the equation for the heat current takes on the infinitesimal form
	
	$$H = \frac{dQ}{dt} = -kA\frac{dT}{dx}$$
	
	- negative sign indicates that heat flows in the direction of decreasing temperature
	- if temperature is increasing with increasing $x$, then $\frac{dT}{dx} \gt 0 \implies H \lt 0$ and so heat flows in the negative x-direction (away from the higher temperature and into the lower one)
	
	**d) thermal resistance** ( $R, \left[\frac{\text{m}^2 \cdot \text{K}}{\text{W}} \right]$ )  - defined for a slab of material with area $A$ so that the heat current through it is
	
	$$H = \frac{A(T_H - T_C)}{R}$$
	
	$$R = \frac{L}{k}$$

2. Convection - heat transfer by means of mass motion of a fluid from one region to another
	
	**a) properties**
	- directly proportional to surface area
	- fluid viscosity slows free convection near a stationary surface
	- heat current due to free convection is approximately proportional to the 1.25 power of the temperature difference between the fluid and the surface 
	
	**b) types**
	- forced convection - a pump is moving the fluid
	- free convection - the fluid moves due to density differences caused by thermal expansion

3. Radiation - transfer of heat by electromagnetic waves given off every object
	
	**a) Stefan-Boltzmann law**
	
	$$H = Ae\sigma T^4$$
	
	- $A, [\text{m}^2]$: area of emitting surface
	- $e \in (0;1)$: emissivity of the surface - the ratio of the rate of radiation of a given surface to the rate of radiation of an ideal surface with the same area at the same temperature; often larger for dark surfaces
	- $\sigma = 5.67037442 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W / m²} \cdot \text{K⁴}$: Stefan-Boltzmann constant
	- $T, [\text{K}]$ - absolute temperature 
	
	**b) absorption** - the surrounds of a body also radiate and some of this radiation gets absorbed by the body. At thermal equilibrium, $T_b = T_s$ and so the rate of absorption must be given by $H = Ae\sigma T_s^4$
	- net heat current of a body at temperature $T_b$ and surrounds at temperature $T_s$
	
	$$H_{\text{net}} = Ae\sigma(T_b^4 - T_s^4)$$
	
	- $H_{\text{net}} \gt 0 \implies$ heat is flowing out of the body
