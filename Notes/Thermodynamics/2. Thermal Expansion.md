1. Definition - most materials expand when heated

2. Linear expansion - for a solid rod with initial length $L_0$ and an initial temperature $T_0$, the change in length, $\Delta L$ is directly proportional to the change in temperature, $\Delta T$, provided that $\Delta T$ is sufficiently small ( $\lt 100\degree C$ ). Additionally, $\Delta L$ is also directly proportional to $L_0$, since two rods made of the same material will expand at different rates when heated.
	
	$$\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T$$
	
	- $\alpha, [K^{-1}]$ - the coefficient of linear expansion which is specific to every material, depends on $T_0$ and $\Delta T$, albeit to a limited degree

3. Volume Expansion - similarly to linear expansion, there is a law of volume expansion
	
	$$\Delta V = \beta V_0 \Delta T$$
	
	- $\beta, [K^{-1}]$ - coefficient of volume expansion, which has the same subtleties as $\alpha$
	
	**a) relationship between the coefficients of linear and volume expansion**
	
	$$\beta = 3\alpha$$
	
	Derivation: Consider a cube with side length $L$ and a volume $V = L^3$.
	
	$$dV = \frac{dV}{dL} dL = 3L^2 dL$$
	
	$$dL = \alpha L_0 dT$$
	
	$$V_0 = L_0^3 \implies dV = 3L_0^2 \alpha L_0 dT = 3\alpha V_0 dT$$
	
	This is consistent with $dV = \beta V_0 dT$ only if $\beta = 3\alpha$.
