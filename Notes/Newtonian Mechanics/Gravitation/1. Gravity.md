1. Newton's Law of Gravitation - every object in the universe attracts every other object in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
	
	$$F_g = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
	
	**a) direction of the gravitational force** - along the line joining the two masses, forming an action-reaction pair
	
	**b) magnitude** - the same for both masses
	- when you fall, you pull on the Earth just as much as it pulls on you, but you don't notice its movement because it is much more massive
	
	**c) the gravitational constant** - measured using a Cavendish torsion balance
	
	$$G = 6.67408(31) \times 10^{-11} [\text{ m}^3\text{kg}^{-1}\text{s}^{-2}] \approx 6.67 \times 10^{-11} [\text{ m}^3\text{kg}^{-1}\text{s}^{-2}]$$

2. Spherical Mass Distributions
	
	**a) gravity on the outside** - the same as if all the sphere's mass were concentrated at the centre
	
	**b) gravity on the inside**
	- zero for a spherical shell
