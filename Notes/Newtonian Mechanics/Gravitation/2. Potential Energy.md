1. Gravitational Potential Energy - the potential energy stored in a system due to gravity
	
	$$U = -\frac{GMm}{r}$$
	
	**a) derivation**
	
	![Gravitational Potential Energy](Resources/Gravitational%20Potential%20Energy.jpg)
	
	The work done by the gravitational force as the object moves from $r_1$ to $r_2$ is given by
	
	$$W_{\text{grav}} = -\int_{r_1}^{r_2} F_g\, dr$$
	
	The minus sign is there because gravity acts opposite the displacement.
	
	By substituting for the force of gravity we obtain
	
	$$W_{\text{grav}} = -GMm\int_{r_1}^{r_2} \frac{1}{r^2} dr = \frac{GMm}{r_2} - \frac{GMm}{r_1}$$
	
	This is the difference in the gravitational potential energies between the two distances, $U_1 - U_2$ and so an appropriate formula for $U$ would be
	
	$$U = -\frac{GMm}{r}$$
	
	**b) small distance approximation**
	
	$$U = mgy$$
	
	Derivation:
	
	$$W_{\text{grav}} = GMm\frac{r_1 - r_2}{r_1r_2}$$
	
	When close to the Earth's surface $r_1r_2$ is approximately equal to the Earth's radius squared and so:
	
	$$W_{\text{grav}} = GMm\frac{r_1-r_2}{R^2}$$
	
	Similarly, the gravitational force varies very little for a small difference $r_1-r_2$ and is therefore given by $G\frac{Mm}{R^2} = mg$. The potential energy then becomes
	
	$$U = mg(r_1-r_2)$$

2. Negativity - gravitational potential energy is always negative
	
	**a) essential property** - gravitational potential energy always increases with distance
	- this must be preserved in our definitions of gravitational potential energy 
	
	**b) reference point** - gravitational potential energy is defined relative to a reference point which is taken to be at infinity and the gravitational potential energy there is defined to be zero
	- when dealing with situations close to Earth's surface, it is easier to take the reference point to be at the Earth's surface and so gravitational potential energy is positive in order to preserve its essential property 
	
	**b) intuition** - in order to separate two masses $M$ and $m$ by a distance $r$, a force needs to be applied and the work done by this force is positive. This work is equal to the difference in the two potential energies and the only way for it to be positive and for the gravitational potential energy to approach zero as the distance approaches infinity is for the gravitational potential energy to have been negative in the first place
	- this preserves the property that gravitational potential *increases* (becomes *less* negative) as distance increases
