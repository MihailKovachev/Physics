1. Point Mass Outside a Spherical Shell - the gravitational force experienced by the point mass is the same as if all the shell's mass were concentrated at its centre
	
	Proof:

	Let the point mass be $m$ and let it be located a distance $r$ from the centre of the shell. Consider a ring on the surface of the shell. This ring is composed of components $m_i$ which are all a distance $s$ from the point mass. 
	
	The potential energy, $dU$, of the interaction between $m$ and the entire ring is given by the potential energies between the point mass and every component of the ring:
	
	$$dU = \sum_{i=0}^n\left(-\frac{Gmm_i}{s}\right) = -\frac{Gm}{s}dM$$
	where the mass of the entire ring is 
	$$dM = \sum_{i=0}^n m_i$$
	
	The radius of the shell is $R$ and so the radius of the ring is $R\sin\phi$. Its width is $R\,d\theta$ and its area is approximately its width times its circumference:
	
	$$dA = 2\pi R^2 \sin\phi\,d\phi$$
	
	The ration of the ring's mass to the shell's total mass is the same as the ring's are to the shell's are because of the uniformity of the distribution.
	
	$$\frac{dM}{M} = \frac{dA}{A} = \frac{2\pi R^2 \sin\phi\,d\phi}{4\pi R^2} = \frac{1}{2}\sin\phi\,d\phi$$
	
	It is now possible to substitute in the expression for the ring's potential energy:
	
	$$dU = -\frac{GMm\sin\phi}{2s} d\phi$$
	
	The total potential energy is the integral as $s$ varies from $r-R$ to $r+R$.
	
	The Pythagorean theorem can be used to find a relationship between $s$ and $\phi$:
	
	$$s^2 = (r - R\cos\phi)^2 + (R\sin\phi)^2 = r^2 - 2rR\cos\phi + R^2$$
	
	Take the differential of both sides:
	
	$$2s\, ds = 2rR\sin\phi\,d\phi \implies d \sin\,d\phi = \frac{s}{rR} ds$$
	
	Substitute in the expression for dU and integrate:
	
	$$dU = -\frac{GMm}{2s}\frac{s}{rR}ds = -\frac{GMm}{2rR} ds$$
	
	$$U = -\frac{GMm}{2rR} \int_{r-R}^{r+R} ds = -\frac{GMm}{r}$$
	
	This is identical to the potential energy formula if all the shell's mass were concentrated at its centre point. The force of gravity is conservative ( $F_g = -\frac{dU}{dr}$ ) which makes this equivalent hold for both the potential energy and the force.
	
	This holds for the more general case of a sphere because the latter can be thought of as a collection of concentric spherical shells and superposition of forces applies. The same holds true for two spherical mass distributions.

2. Point Mass Inside a Spherical Shell - the gravitational force experienced by the point mass is zero and its potential energy is constant
	
	Proof:
	
	![Point Mass Inside a Spherical Shell](Resources/Point%20Mass%20Inside%20a%20Spherical%20Shell.jpg)
	
	Much of the previous analysis applies here, but the limits of integration have to be changed in the end:
	
	$$U = -\frac{GMm}{2rR}\int_{R-r}^{R+r} ds = -\frac{GMm}{R}$$
	
	The potential energy therefore does not depend on the distance between the point mass and the centre of the sphere.

	$$F_g = \frac{GMm}{R^3}r$$

	Derivation:
	The gravitational force experienced by the point mass ( $m$ ) is only the gravitational force caused by the spherical mass distribution with a radius equal to the distance between $m$ and the centre of the sphere. This is true because the outer part of the solid sphere can be thought of as a collection of concentric shells and since the point mass is inside them, they do exert a net gravitational force on it equal to zero.
	
	Let the inner spherical segment have a radius $r$ and mass $M_{\text{inner}}$. The ratio of its mass to the mass of the entire sphere $M$ is equal to the ratio of their volumes due to the uniform density.
	
	$$\frac{M_{\text{inner}}}{M} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} \implies M_{\text{inner}} = \frac{r^3}{R^3} = M\frac{r^3}{R^3}$$
	
	The gravitational force is 
	
	$$F_g = \frac{GM_{\text{inner}}m}{r^2} = \frac{Gm}{r^2}\left(M\frac{r^3}{R^3}\right) = \frac{GMm}{R^3}r$$
	
	Therefore, inside a solid, uniform-density sphere, the gravitational force experienced by a point mass is proportional to $1/r$ instead of $1/r^2$.
