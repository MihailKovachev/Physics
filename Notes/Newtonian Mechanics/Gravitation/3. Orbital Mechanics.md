1. Escape Velocity - the minimum speed required for an object to escape the gravitational pull of a planet
	
	$$v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$
	
	**a) derivation**
	
	The energy of the object at the planet's surface is equal to the sum of its initial kinetic and gravitational energies:
	
	$$E_1 = \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 - \frac{GMm}{R}$$
	
	In order for the object to escape the planet and not return to it, we want it to essentially stop only when it reaches infinity (i.e. never) and so the energy at that point would be given by
	
	$$E_2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 - \frac{GMm}{\infty} = 0-0 = 0$$
	
	By conservation of mechanical energy we have
	
	$$E_1 = E_2 \implies \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 - \frac{GMm}{R} = 0$$
	
	By rearranging and dividing by $m$ we obtain
	
	$$v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$

2. Circular Orbits - the only force acting on the object is the gravitational pull it experiences and so it is undergoing uniform circular motion
	
	**a) speed-radius relationship** - the speed required for an orbit with a chosen radius is fixed and does not depend on the mass of the orbiting object, only on the mass of the object it is revolving around
	
	$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$
	
	Derivation: 
	
	The gravitational force experienced by the object is $G\frac{Mm}{r^2}$ and it is the only force acting on it so $G\frac{Mm}{r^2} = ma$. There is uniform circular motion so the acceleration is completely radial and $a = \frac{v^2}{r}$. Equate the two formulas:
	
	$$G\frac{Mm}{r^2} = m\frac{v^2}{r}$$
	
	$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$
	
	**b) orbital period** - the time it takes for one revolution around the orbit
	
	$$T = 2\pi r\sqrt{\frac{r}{GM}}$$
	
	Derivation: 
	
	The period is just the length of the orbit divided by the object's speed. Therefore, the orbital period is also fixed for a given orbital radius.
	
	$$T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} = \frac{2\pi r}{\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}} = 2\pi r\sqrt{\frac{r}{GM}}$$
	
	Properties: 
	- larger orbital radii result in longer periods and slower orbital speeds
	
	**c) total mechanical energy** - given by the kinetic and potential energy for the orbit because the orbital speed and radius are fixed
	
	$$E = -\frac{GMm}{2r} = \frac{1}{2} U$$
	
	Derivation:
	
	$$E = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} = \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{GM}{r} \right) - \frac{GMm}{r}$$

3. Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion - corollaries of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation
	
	**a) first law** - each planet moves in an elliptical orbit with the star at one of its foci
	
	![Kepler's First Law](Resources/Kepler's%20First%20Law.jpg)
	
	- major and minor axes - the longest and smallest dimensions of the ellipse
	- the semi-major and semi-minor axes - the half-lengths of the major and minor axes
	- eccentricity ( $e$ ) - a dimensionless number describing how squashed the ellipse is
	- perihilion - the point closest to the star
	- aphelion - the point farthest from the star
	- $SP + S'P = \text{const}$
	
	**b) second law** - a line from the Star to a given planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times
	
	$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \text{const}$$
	
	![Kepler's Second Law](Resources/Kepler's%20Second%20Law.jpg)
	
	Derivation: 
	
	This law is a corollary of the conservation of angular momentum and essentially states that the sector velocity $\left(\frac{dA}{dt}\right)$ is constant throughout the orbit.
	
	The angular momentum of the planet as it orbits around the star is 
	
	$$L = mvl = mvr\sin \phi$$
	
	The area swept out by the line SP is 
	
	$$dA = \frac{1}{2}r^2\,d\theta \implies \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r v_{\perp} = \frac{1}{2} r v\sin \phi$$
	
	This is the magnitude of the cross product $\vec{r}\times\vec{v} = \frac{1}{m} \vec{L}$ (recall the formula for angular momentum). Therefore,
	
	$$\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2m} \vert \vec{r}\times m\vec{v}| = \frac{L}{2m}$$
	
	The right-hand side is constant because the only force acting on the planet is gravity and it causes no torque because it acts along the line SP.
	
	![Kepler's Second Law (2)](Resources/Kepler's%20Second%20Law%20(2).jpg)
	
	**c) third law** - the orbital period for a planet is proportional to the 3/2 power of its semi-major axis
	
	$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}a^3$$
	
4. Centre of Mass - in reality, both the star and the planet orbit around their common centre of mass but this effect is negligible due their mass difference
