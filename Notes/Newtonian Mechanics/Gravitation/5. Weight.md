1. True Weight ( $\vec{w}_0$ )- the total gravitational force exerted on an object by all other objects in the universe
	
	**a) free-fall acceleration** ( $g$ ) - the same for all objects
	
	Proof:
	
	Suppose that a planet has mass $M$ and a smaller mass $m$ is in free fall. The gravitational forces caused by the rest of the objects in the universe are negligible, since they are too far away.
	
	The only force acting on $m_1$ (ignoring air resistance) is then the gravitational force:
	
	$$F_g = ma$$
	
	$$G\frac{Mm}{r^2} = ma \implies a = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$
	
	Therefore, the object's acceleration is independent of its mass and we call this acceleration $g$.
	
	**b) distance variance** - weight is inversely proportional to the distance

2. Apparent Weight ( $\vec{w}$ )- the weight measured by an observer, which is different from the true weight because the Earth is rotating
	
	$$\vec{w} = \vec{w}_0 - m\vec{a}_{\text{rad}}$$
