1. Potential Energy ( $U, [\text{J}]$ ) - the amount of work that a system is capable of doing by means of a certain interaction
	
	**a) conservative forces** - a force which offers a two-way conversion between kinetic and potential energy
	- can be expressed as the difference between the initial and final values of a potential-energy function
	- reversible
	- independent of the path of an object and only depending on the start and end point
	- the total work is zero when the starting and ending point are the same
	- $W = -\Delta U$
	
	**b) conservative force from potential energy**
	
	$$\vec{F} = -\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\hat{\imath} + \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\hat{\jmath} + \frac{\partial U}{\partial z}\hat{k}\right) = -\vec{\nabla} U$$
	
	Derivation:
	
	Since $W = -\Delta U$,
	
	$$F_x = -\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta x}, F_y = -\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta y}, F_z = -\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta z}$$
	
	Taking the limit, we get:
	
	$$F_x = -\frac{dU}{dx}, F_y = -\frac{dU}{dy}, F_z = -\frac{dU}{dz}$$
	
	And the force vector therefore looks like:
	
	$$\vec{F} = F_x\hat{\imath} + F_y\hat{\jmath} + F_z\hat{k} = -\frac{dU}{dx}\hat{\imath} -\frac{dU}{dy}\hat{\jmath} -\frac{dU}{dz}\hat{k} = -\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\hat{\imath} + \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\hat{\jmath} + \frac{\partial U}{\partial z}\hat{k}\right)$$
	

2. Gravitational Potential Energy - the work that an object can do when under the influence of gravity
	
	![Gravitational Potential Energy](Resources/Gravitational%20Potential%20Energy.jpg)
	
	**a) definition** - the work that an object will do when it falls from a certain height to the ground
	
	$$U_{\text{grav}} = mgy$$
	
	**b) change in gravitational potential energy**
	
	$$\Delta U_{\text{grav}} = -W_{\text{grav}}$$
	
	Derivation:
	
	$$W_{\text{grav}} = w(y_1-y_2) = mgy_1-mgy_2 = U_{\text{grav, 1}} - U_{\text{grav, 2}} = - (U_{\text{grav, 2}} - U_{\text{grav, 1}}) = -\Delta U_{\text{grav}}$$
	
	Notice that this holds true even along a curved path:
	
	$$W_{\text{grav}} = \vec{w}\cdot\vec{\Delta s} = -mg\hat{\jmath} \cdot (\Delta x\hat{\imath} + \Delta y\hat{\jmath}) = -mg\Delta y$$
	
	![Curved Path Gravitational Potential Energy](Resources/Curved%20Path%20Gravitational%20Potential%20Energy.jpg)
	
	**c) gravitational potential energy for an extended body** - the same as if all the mass was concentrated at the centre of mass
	
	$$U_{\text{grav}} = Mgy_{\text{cm}}$$
	
	Derivation:
	The potential energy for the system is the sum of the potential energies of its components. If the difference in the gravitational force is negligible, then
	
	$$U_{\text{grav}} = \sum_{i=1}^n m_igy_i = g\sum_{i=1}^n m_iy_i = gMy_{\text{cm}}$$
	

3. Elastic Potential Energy - the work that a spring can do when released from a certain displacement
	
	$$U_{\text{el}} = \frac{1}{2}k{x}^2$$
	
	Derivation:
	The force a string stretched by an amount of $x$ exerts on an object depends on the displacement $x$ as per Hooke's law. This force is equal to $kx$ and the work it does for an infinitesimally small displacement $dx$ is given by the following integral:
	
	$$\int_0^x kx dx = k\int_0^x x dx = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
	
	Notice that the spring force acts along the displacement once the spring is released and so its work must be positive.

4. Internal Energy ( $U_{\text{int}}, [\text{J}]$ ) - the energy associated with nonconservative forces acting on a system
	
	**a) change in internal energy** - the negative of the work done on the system by nonconservative forces
	
	$$\Delta U_{\text{int}} = -W_{\text{other}}$$
