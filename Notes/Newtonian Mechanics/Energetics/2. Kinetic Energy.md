1. Kinetic Energy - the work required to bring an object from rest to a certain speed
	
	$$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
	
	**a) work-energy theorem** - the total work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy
	
	$$\Delta K = K_2 - K_1 = \frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 = W_{\text{total}}$$
