1. Rigid Body - an idealised model of an object with perfectly definite shape and size which do not change

2. Rotational Motion - always occurs around a certain axis and in a particular plane
	
	**a) angular position** ( $\theta, [\text{rad}]$ ) - the angle the object makes in the plane with respect to a fixed axis in it
	- angular displacement ( $\Delta \theta$ ) - the difference in the angle at two different times
	
	![Angular Displacement](Resources/Angular%20Displacement.jpg)
	
	**b) angular velocity** - the same for all points of a rigid body

3. Angular Velocity ( $\vec{\omega}, [\text{rad/s}]$ ) - a pseudovector representation of rotational motion
	
	**a) magnitude** - the angular speed ( $\omega \ge 0$ )
	
	**b) direction** - always perpendicular to the direction of rotation
	
	![Angular Velocity](Resources/Angular%20Velocity.jpg)
	
	**c) components** - it is useful to examine angular velocity in a coordinate system relative to the object's orientation in space so that we only have to deal with one of angular velocity's components: the axis of rotation conventionally being the z-axis and the plane of rotation being the xy-plane
	
	$$\omega_z = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$$
	
	**d) units**
	
	$$1 \text{ rev/s} = 2\pi \text{ rad/s}$$
	
	$$1 \text{ rpm} = 1 {\text{ rev/min}} = \frac{2\pi}{60} \text{ rad/s}$$

4. Angular Acceleration ( $\vec{\alpha}, [\text{rad/sÂ²}]$ ) - the change in angular velocity (both the axis of rotation as well as speed)
	
	$$\vec{\alpha} = \frac{d\vec{\omega}}{dt}$$
	
	**a) fixed axis of rotation** - the acceleration lies on the axis of rotation
	
	$$\alpha_z = \frac{d\omega_z}{dt} = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}$$
	
	**b) equations of rotation with constant acceleration** - identical to the equations for 1D motion with constant linear acceleration

5. Relations to Linear Kinematics - every point of the rigid body is undergoing circular motion at a constant distance $r$ from the axis of rotation
	
	**a) speed**
	
	$$v = r\omega$$
	
	![Linear and Angular Speed](Resources/Linear%20and%20Angular%20Speed.jpg)
	
	Derivation:
	$$s = r\theta$$
	
	$$\left|\frac{ds}{dt}\right| = r\left|\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right|$$
	
	**b) acceleration**
	
	$$a_{\text{tan}} = \frac{dv}{dt} = r\frac{d\omega}{dt} = r\alpha$$
	
	$$a_{\text{rad}} = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r$$
