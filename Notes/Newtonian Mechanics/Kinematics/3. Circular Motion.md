1. Uniform Circular Motion - motion in a circle with a constant speed
	
	![Circular Motion Acceleration](Resources/Circular%20Motion%20Acceleration.jpg)
	
	**a) average acceleration**
	- magnitude 

	$$a_{\text{av}} = \frac{|\Delta \vec{v}|}{\Delta t} = \frac{v}{R}\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t},(v = |\vec{v}_1| = |\vec{v}_2|)$$
	
	Derivation: Since $OP_1 \perp \vec{v}_1$ and $OP_2 \perp \vec{v}_2$, it follows that $\angle P_1OP_2 = \angle(\vec{v}_1, O, \vec{v}_2) = \Delta \phi$ (move the velocity vectors so that they begin at $O$). Therefore, 
	
	$$\triangle P_1OP_2 \sim \triangle(\vec{v_1}, O, \vec{v_2}) \implies \frac{v}{R} = \frac{|\Delta \vec{v}|}{\Delta s}$$
	
	$$|\Delta\vec{v}{}| = \frac{v}{R}\Delta s \implies a_{\text{av}} = \frac{|\Delta \vec{v}|}{\Delta t} = \frac{v}{R}\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$$
	
	**b) radial acceleration** - the instantaneous acceleration, which is the limit as $\Delta t \to 0$
	
	$$a_{\text{rad}} = \frac{v^2}{R}$$
	
	Derivation: 
	
	$$\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = \frac{ds}{dt} = v$$
	
	Properties:
	- always perpendicular to the velocity and pointing towards the centre
	
	**c) period** ( $T, [\text{s}]$ ) - the time for one revolution around the circle. In this time, a distance of $2\pi R$ is travelled and since the speed is constant:
	
	$$v = \frac{2\pi R}{T} \implies a_{\text{rad}} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2}$$

2. Non-uniform Circular Motion - motion around a circular path with non-constant velocity
	
	![Non-uniform Circular Motion Acceleration](Resources/Non-uniform%20Circular%20Motion%20Acceleration.jpg)
	
	**a) acceleration** - also non-constant and with two components 
	- radial acceleration - the component perpendicular to the velocity (the same as with uniform circular motion)
	
	$$a_{\text{rad}} \equiv a_{\perp}= \frac{v^2}{R}$$
	
	- tangential acceleration - the component parallel to the velocity (the change in speed)
	
	$$a_{\text{tan}} \equiv a_{\parallel} = \frac{d|\vec{v}|}{dt} = \frac{dv}{dt}$$
