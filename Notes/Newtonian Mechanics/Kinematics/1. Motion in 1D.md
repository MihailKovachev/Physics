1. Displacement, time and average velocity
	
	![Displacement, time and average velocity](Resources/Displacement,%20time%20and%20average%20velocity.jpg)
	
	**a) displacement** - a vector pointing from the start point to the end point
	- its x-component, denoted $\Delta x$ is the change in the value of $x$
	
	**b) average velocity** - a vector whose x-component is the change in $x$ divided by the time interval
	
	$$v_{\text{av}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}$$
	
	- movement in the positive x-direction $\implies v_{\text{av}} \gt 0$
	- movement in the negative x-direction $\implies v_{\text{av}} \lt 0$

2. Instantaneous Velocity (or just velocity) - the average velocity as the displacement and the time interval become arbitrarily small
	
	$$v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}$$
	
	**a) sign** - the same rules apply as those for the sign of average velocity
	
	**b) speed** - the magnitude of velocity which is always non-negative

3. Acceleration
	
	**a) average acceleration** - a vector whose x-component is the change in velocity divided by the time interval
	
	$$a_{\text{av}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{2} - v_{1}}{t_2 - t_1}$$
	
	**b) instantaneous acceleration** - the average acceleration as the time interval gets arbitrarily small
	
	$$a_x = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt}$$

4. Motion with Constant Acceleration
	
	**a) velocity**
	
	$$v = \int{a} dt = v_{0} + at$$
	
	**b) position**
	
	$$x = \int{v} dt = \frac{1}{2}at^2 + v_{0}t + x_0$$
	
	**c) relationships which do not depend on time or acceleration** - these can be derived by substitutimg into the above two equations
	
	$$v^2 = v_{0}^2 + 2a(x-x_0)$$
	
	$$x - x_0 = \frac{1}{2}(v_{0} + v)t$$

5. Free Fall - motion with (nearly) constant acceleration under the influence of gravity
	
	**a) acceleration due to gravity** - its magnitude is denoted by $g$
	
	$$g = 9.8 \text{ m/sÂ²}$$
