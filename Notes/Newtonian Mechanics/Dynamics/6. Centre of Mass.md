1. Centre of Mass - a mass-weighted average position of the components of a system
	
	$$\vec{r}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n m_i\vec{r}_i}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n m_i}$$
	
	**Ð°) solid homogeneous objects**

	- if the object has a geometric centre, then the centre of mass is located there
	- if an object has an axis of symmetry, the centre of mass lies on this axis
	- the centre of mass need not be inside the object
	
2. Relation to the total momentum of a system - the total momentum of a system is equal to the total mass times the velocity of the centre of mass
	
	$$\vec{P} = M\vec{v}_\text{cm}$$
	
	Derivation:
	
	$$\vec{v}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{d}{dt}\vec{r}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n m_i\frac{d\vec{r}_i}{dt}}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n m_i} = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n m_i\vec{v}_i}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n m_i} = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \vec{p}_i}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n m_i} = \frac{1}{M}\vec{P}$$
	
3. Effect of external forces - when a system is under the influence of external forces, its centre of mass moves as if all the mass was concentrated there
	
	$$\sum \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = M\vec{a}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}$$
	
	Derivation:
	
	$$\vec{v}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n m_i\vec{v}_i}{M}$$
	
	$$M\vec{v}_{\text{cm}} = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i\vec{v}_i$$
	
	$$M\frac{d}{dt}\vec{v}_{\text{cm}} = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i\frac{d\vec{v}_i}{dt}$$
	
	$$M\vec{a}_{\text{cm}} = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i\vec{a}_i = \sum_{i=1}^n \vec{F}_i$$
	
	$\vec{F}_i$ is the sum of the forces acting on the $i$-th component now of the system. Now, this sum includes forces which are both internal and external for the system, but Newton's third law tells us that the internal forces in the system will cancel out. Therefore, $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \vec{F}_i$ contains only the external forces. 
	
	Additionally,
	$$M\frac{d}{dt}\vec{v}_{\text{cm}} = \frac{d}{dt}(M\vec{v}_{\text{cm}}) = \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}$$

4. Motion of Rigid Bodies - the motion of any rigid body can be represented as a translation of the centre of mass and a rotation about the centre of mass
