1. Inelastic Collisions - the total kinetic energy after the collision is less than the total kinetic energy before it
	
	**a) completely inelastic collisions** - the two colliding objects stick together and continue their motion with the same velocity

	$$m_A\vec{v}_{A1} + m_B\vec{v}_{B1} = (m_A +m_B)\vec{v}_2$$
	

2. Elastic Collisions - the total kinetic energy of the system before and after the collision is preserved
	$$\begin{cases}m_A\vec{v}_{A1} + m_B\vec{v}_{B1} = m_A\vec{v}_{A2}+m_B\vec{v}_{B2} \\ \frac{1}{2}m_Av_{A1}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_Bv_{B1}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_Av_{A2}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_Bv_{B2}^2\end{cases}$$
