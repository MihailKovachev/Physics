1. Linear Momentum ( $\vec{p}$ ) - a quantity of motion which characterises how difficult it is if for a linearly moving mass to stop
	
	$$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$$
	
	**a) intuition**
	- it is more difficult to stop a big mass (a train) moving at a certain speed rather than to stop a small mass (a bike) moving at the same speed
	- it is more difficult to stop a mass moving at a high speed speed than to stop the same mass moving at a slow speed
	
	**b) Newton's second law** - as originally stated
	
	$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$$
	
	**c) conservation of momentum** - if there is no net external force acting on a system, then the total momentum of its components is constant
	
	$$\vec{P} = \sum_{i=1}^n \vec{p}_i = \text{const}$$
	
	$$\frac{d\vec{P}}{dt} = \vec{0}$$
	
	Reasoning: When there is no net external force, the only forces acting in the system are internal ones between its components. According to Newton's third law, each of these forces begets a reaction force, thus changing the momenta of both interacting components. Since these forces are exactly equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so are the changes in the momenta of the interacting components and their vector sum is 0.

2. Impulse ( $\vec{J}$ )  - the amount of change in the momentum of an object that the net external force begets in the span of a given time period
	
	$$\vec{J} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \vec{F}_{\text{net}} dt$$
	
	Intuition:
	
	$$\vec{J} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \vec{F}_{\text{net}} dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} dt = \int_{p_1}^{p_2} d\vec{p} = \vec{p}_2 - \vec{p}_1$$
	

3. Momentum vs Kinetic Energy
	
	**a) momentum** - describes the relation between the *force* and the *time* it needs to be applied for to bring a mass to a stop
	
	**b) kinetic energy** - describes the relation between the *force* and the *distance* over which it needs to be applied to bring a mass to a stop
