1. Force - a vector which describes an interaction between two objects
	
	**a) magnitude** ( $F, [\text{N = kg }\cdot\text{m/sÂ²}]$ ) - measured in Newtons
	
	**b) superposition** - any number of forces applied to *the same point* on an object have the same effect as  a single force which is the vector sum of the forces called the *net force*
	
	$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \vec{F}_i$$
	
	$$F_{\text{net}} = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2 + F_z^2}$$
	

2. Weight - the gravitational force which Earth exerts on an object
	
	$$\vec{w} = m\vec{g}$$
	

3. Normal Force ( $\vec{n}, \vec{F}_n$ ) - a reaction force which appears whenever an object is pressed against a surface.
	
	**a) direction**
	- always perpendicular to the surface
	- always pointing away from the surface
	
	**b) magnitude** - the magnitude of the component of the pressing force which acts directly towards the surface
	
	- normal force caused by weight
	
	$$n = w \cos\theta$$

	Derivation:
	
	We choose our coordinate system to be the along the incline and the normal force. The y-component of the weight of the block is thus the one acting towards the surface and it is $w_y = -w\cos\theta$. The normal force in this coordinate system has only a y-component but it is in the opposite direction of that of the weight and so
	
	$$n_y = -w_y = -(-w\cos\theta) = w\cos\theta \implies n = w\cos\theta$$
	
	Notice that this holds true even when there is no incline and so $\theta = 0$. The cosine of zero is one and so the normal force would be equal in magnitude to the entire weight of the block, which is what you would expect.
