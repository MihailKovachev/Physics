1. Equilibrium - a state where an object does not undergo any change in motion
	
	**a) static equilibrium** - the object does not undergo any sort of acceleration and its velocity is zero
	
	**b) dynamic equilibrium** - the object undergoes uniform translational motion without any acceleration and rotation
	
	**c) conditions for equilibrium**
	- there is no net external force
	- there is no net external torque

2. Centre of Gravity - the weight of an object does not act at a single point, but the torque generated by it can always be calculated by assuming that all the weight is concentrated at this point
	
	**a) location**
	- when the acceleration due to gravity is uniform across an object - the centre of gravity is the same as the centre of mass
	- for symmetrical objects - the centre of gravity lies on the axis of symmetry
	- for objects in rotational equilibrium that are acted on only by gravity and are suspended at a single point - the centre of gravity is always at or directly above or below the point of suspension

	**b) properties**
	- when the centre of gravity is outside the object's support, the object tips over
	- the lower the centre of gravity, the more difficult it is to overturn an object
