1. First Law of Motion - an object acted on by no net external force has a constant velocity and no acceleration
	
	**a) equilibrium** - when an object is either at rest or moving with constant velocity
	
	$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \vec{0}$$
	
	**b) intertial frame of reference** - a frame of reference which is not undergoing any acceleration
	- the first law is only valid in such a frame of reference
	- a frame of reference $B$ is inertial if it moves with a constant velocity relative to an inertial frame of reference $A$

2. Second Law of Motion - if a net external force acts on an object, the object accelerates. This law is only valid for intertial frames of reference.
	
	![Newton's Second Law](Resources/Newton's%20Second%20Law.jpg)
	
	$$\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m\vec{a}$$
	
	**a) direction of acceleration** - the same as the direction of the force
	
	**b) magnitude of acceleration** - directly proportional to the magnitude of the force
	- inertial mass ( $m, [\text{kg}]$ ) - the ability to resist acceleration
	
	$$m = \frac{|\vec{F}_{\text{net}}|}{a} \Leftrightarrow |\vec{F}_{\text{net}}| = ma \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{|\vec{F}_{\text{net}}|}{m}$$
	

3. Third Law of Motion - if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts a force on object A which has the same magnitude but is opposite in direction
	
	![Newton's Third Law](Resources/Newton's%20Third%20Law.jpg)
	
	$$\vec{F}_{\text{A on B}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{B on A}}$$
	
	*These forces act on different objects and so don't cancel each other out.*
