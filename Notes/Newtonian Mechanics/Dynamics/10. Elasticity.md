1. Stress - a measure of the force per the area that it is applied over
	
	**a) units**
	- pascal: $\text{Pa} = \text{N/mÂ²}$

2. Strain - a measure of the deformation caused by a certain amount of rest which is represented as the *change* in size divided by the original size)

3. Hooke's Law - for a sufficiently small stress, the resulting strain is directly proportional to the stress with the proportionality constant being called the *elastic modulus*
	
	$$\frac{\text{Stress}}{\text{Strain}} = \text{Elastic modulus}$$
	
	**a) properties**
	- the elastic modulus depends on the material of the object but not its shape or size
	
4. Young's Modulus ( $Y, [\text{Pa}]$ ) - a material property
	
	**a) for tension** - when an object is stretched
	
	![Young's Modulus](Resources/Young's%20Tensile%20Modulus.jpg)
	
	$$Y = \frac{\text{Tensile stress}}{\text{Tensile strain}} = \frac{F_{\perp}}{A}\frac{l_0}{\Delta l}$$
	
	**b) for compression**
	
	![Young's Compressive Modulus](Resources/Young's%20Compressive%20Modulus.jpg)
	
	$$Y = \frac{\text{Compressive stress}}{\text{Compressive strain}} = \frac{F_{\perp}}{A}\frac{l_0}{\Delta l}$$
	
	**c) properties**
	- materials with large $Y$ values are more difficult to stretch or compress
	- most materials have the same Young moduli for tension and compression with stone and concrete being notable exceptions - the latter can withstand high compressive stress but fail under comparable tensile stress

5. Bulk Modulus - a measure of how much the volume of an object changes due to a uniform pressure acting over its entire surface
	
	$$B = \frac{\text{Bulk stress}}{\text{Bulk strain}} = -\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta V/V_0} = -V_0\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta V}$$
	
	**a) properties**
	- an increase in pressure causes a decrease in volume
	
	**b) compressibility** - the fractional decrease in volume per a unit change in pressure
	
	$$k = \frac{1}{B} = -\frac{1}{V_0}\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta p}$$

6. Shear Modulus - forces are applied tangent to opposite sides of the object which causes one face to be displaced relative to its opposite face by a distance $x$
	
	$$S = \frac{\text{Shear stress}}{\text{Shear strain}} = \frac{F_{\parallel}}{x/h} = \frac{F_{\parallel}}{A}\frac{h}{x}$$
	
	![Shear Stress and Strain](Resources/Shear%20Stress%20and%20Strain.jpg)
	
	**a) shear stress**
	
	$$\text{Shear stress} = \frac{F_{\parallel}}{A}$$
	
	**b) shear strain**
	
	$$\text{Shear strain} = \frac{x}{h}$$
	
	**c) properties**
	- applies only to solid object
	- the shear modulus for most materials is usually a third to a half of Young's modulus for tension

7. Elasticity and Plasticity 
	
	**a) elastic deformations** - deformations which are reversible and the object naturally returns to them after the stress is gone
	- elastic hysteresis - a phenomenon where a material follows different curves for increasing and decreasing stress and does less work when returning to its original form than is needed to deform it
	
	![Elastic Hysteresis](Resources/Elastic%20Hysteresis.jpg)
	
	
	**b) plastic deformations** - the object remains deformed even after the stress is gone
	
	**c) stress-strain diagrams**
	
	![Stress-Strain Diagram](Resources/Stress-Strain%20Diagram.jpg)
	
	- proportional limit - the stress at which Hooke's law stops being obeyed
	- yield point - the point at which elastic behaviour becomes plastic
	- elastic limit - the stress at the yield point
	- permanent set - the strain which remains after the stress in a plastic deformation has been removed
