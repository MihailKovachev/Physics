1. Ideal Fluid - an incompressible fluid with no viscosity
	
	**a) incompressible fluids** - fluids with constant density
	- liquids
	- gases with a negligible pressure gradient over different regions

2. Fluid Flow
	
	**a) laminar flow** - a steady fluid flow where adjacent layers of fluid slide past each other
	
	**b) turbulent flow** - an irregular and chaotic fluid flow which arises when a certain critical speed is reached
	- depends on the viscosity - the more viscous the fluid, the more it is able to sustain laminar flow
	
	**c) flow tube** - the collection of imaginary flow lines which flow through the edge of a fluid element
	
	**d) viscosity** - internal friction in a fluid which opposes the motion of one portion of fluid relative to another
	- temperature-dependent: proportional for gases and inversely proportional for liquids
	- boundary layer - viscous fluids always form a layer on top of any solid they come in contact with which moves very slowly because fluids want to stick to solids
	- pressure required to sustain a certain volume flow rate through a pipe when the fluid is viscous is proportional to $\frac{L}{R^4}$ for the length and radius of the pipe, respectively

	**e) properties** - mass remains constant when the fluid is flowing

3. Flow Rates
	
	**a) volume flow rate** - the volume of the fluid which flows through a section of the fluid 
	
	$$\frac{dV}{dt} = Av$$
	
	Derivation:
	
	The volume of fluid which flows through a small section of fluid is given by the section's cross-sectional area and the small distance the fluid travels for the small time interval.
	
	$$dV = A\,ds = Av\,dt \implies \frac{dV}{dt} = Av$$
	
	**b) the continuity equation** - the mass flowing through any section of the fluid is the same
	
	$$\rho_1A_1v_1 = \rho_2A_2v_2$$
	
	Derivation:
	
	![The Continuity Equation](Resources/The%20Continuity%20Equation.jpg)
	
	$$dV_1 = A_1v_1 \implies \frac{dm}{\rho_1} = A_1v_1 \implies dm = \rho_1A_1v_1$$
	
	$$dV_2 = A_2v_2 \implies \frac{dm}{\rho_2} = A_2v_2 \implies dm = \rho_2A_2v_2$$
	
	**c) incompressible fluids**
	- constant volume flow rate due to their constant density
	
	$$\frac{dV}{dt} = \text{const} \implies A_1v_1 = A_2v_2$$
	
	- the fluid velocity in a section is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area 

4. Bernoullie's Equation - valid for laminar flow
	
	$$p + \rho gy + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 = \text{const}$$
	
	Derivation:
	
	![Bernoullie's Equation](Resources/Bernoullie's%20Equation.jpg)
	
	The fluid sections between $a$ and $b$ and $c$ and $d$ have cross-sectional areas $A_1$ and $A_2$, respectively, and the fluid through them moves with speeds $v_1$ and $v_2$.
	
	The fluid is ideal, therefore incompressible, and so $dV = A_1\,ds_1 = A_2\,ds_2$. 
	
	Pressure forces by the surrounding forces are at play and have magnitudes $p_1A_1$ and $p_2A_2$, respectively. The total work done by them is
	
	$$dW = p_1A_1\,ds_1 - p_2A_2\,ds_2 = (p_1-p_2)dV$$
	
	The work done by the second force is against the direction of displacement and thus has a negative sign. By the work-energy theorem, $dW$ is equal to the net change in the kinetic and potential energy:
	
	$$dW = dK + dU$$
	
	The difference in kinetic energy is given by:
	
	$$dK = \frac{1}{2}dm\,(v_2^2-v_1^2) = \frac{1}{2}\rho\,dV\,(v_2^2-v_1^2)$$
	
	The difference in potential energy is 
	$$dU = dm\,g(y_2-y_1) = \rho\,dV\,g(y_2-y_1)$$
	
	Combining the three equations...
	
	$$(p_1-p_2)dV = \frac{1}{2}\rho\,dV\,(v_2^2-v_1^2) + \rho\,dV\,g(y_2-y_1)$$
	
	$$\Downarrow$$
	
	$$p_1-p_2 = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 + \rho gy_2 - \rho gy_1$$
	
	Rearrange the terms to complete the proof: 
	$$p_1+ \rho gy_1+ \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 = p_2+ \rho gy_2+ \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2$$
