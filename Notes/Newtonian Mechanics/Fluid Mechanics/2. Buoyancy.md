1. The Buoyant Force 
	
	**a) Archimedes' principle** - when an object is immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the object equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object
	
	Proof:
	
	![Archimedes Principle](Resources/Archimedes%20Principle.jpg)
	
	Consider a fluid in equilibrium and, more specifically, an element in this fluid. The net force on it must be zero, therefore, the y-components of all the surface forces must neutralise the weight of the element - resulting in an upward force. Additionally, the net torque must also be zero and so the line of action of this force must pass through the element's centre of gravity.
	
	When the fluid element is replaced with an object of the same shape, the pressures remain the same and so does the buoyant force. Note that its line of action is still along the centre of gravity of the *fluid element* and *not the object.*
	
	**b) properties**
	- depends only the *fluid's* density and the volume of the displaced fluid

2. Floating - depends on the average densities of the object and the fluids
	
	$$\rho_{\text{object}} \lt \rho_{\text{fluid}} \implies \text{object floats and is only partially submerged}$$
	
	$$\rho_{\text{object}} = \rho_{\text{fluid}} \implies \text{object is completely submerged but does not sink}$$
	
	$$\rho_{\text{object}} \gt \rho_{\text{fluid}} \implies \text{object sinks}$$
